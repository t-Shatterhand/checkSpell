# checkSpell
Simple console application to check vocabulary in texts with usage of self-generated dictionaries

You can use file "eng_wikipedia_2016_300K-sentences.txt" as a basic dictionary, though it can be formed from any other text file you'd choose. 
If you'll add more than one dictionary, it will group everything together. 
The corrected files are named "_corrected" in the end of original filename. They are placed in the same, with original file, directory.
