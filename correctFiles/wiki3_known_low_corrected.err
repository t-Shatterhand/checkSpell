The bog Bang theory si the prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation of a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws for physics r extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are decided withe this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age for the universe. the the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to low the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halls of dark matter, eventually forming he stars and galaxies visible today.

Since Georges Matter first noted in 1927 that un expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once decided between supporters of two different theories, the dig Bang and the Steady stat theory, but a wide range or empirical evidence has strongly favored the dig Bang which his now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent wit the hypothesis ov an expanding universe. if 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was disconered, with was crucial evidence in favor fo the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was disconered. More recently, measurements or the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion one the universe as accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can b used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail back in time to an initial stat of extra density and temperature.
