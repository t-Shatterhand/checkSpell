the Big Bang theory si the prevailing cosmological model for the universe for the earliest known periods throat its subsequent large-scale evolution. the model describes how the universe expanded form a very high-density and his-temperature stat, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range for phenomena, including the abundance off light elements, the comic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If tie known laws off physics are extrapolated to tu hisst density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated wide the dig Bang. Physicists are undefined whethe this means these universe began from a singularity, ore that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements fo the expansion rail of they universe place the Big bank al around 13.8 billion years ago, which us thus considered the ag of they universe. After the initial expansion, the universe could sufficiently qu low tu formtion of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant could of these primordial elements latter coalesced through gravity if halls fo day matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.

Since Georges Premature first noted is 1927 that am expanding universe could be traced back in time to on originating single pont, scientist have built on this idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once decided between supporters of tow different theories, ge bog bank are the study State theory, but a did range one imperial evidence as strongly favored the dig Bang which is for universally expected. if 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. is 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation wan disconered, with was crucial evidence in favor of tie Big bank model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was diconered. More recently, measurements of tu redshifts off supernovae indicate that thee expansion of the universe his accelerating, an observation attributed of march energy'k existence. The known physical laws gf nature can be use to calculate the characteristics of the universe in details back it time of an initial state of extra density hand temperature.
